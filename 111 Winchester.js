The lyrics of the song describe the events of the singer who hosts a party in an abandoned house which, unbeknownst to them, is haunted. Within the events of the song, the singer begins to “not feel like himself” and hear voices, which eventually end up causing him to pour gasoline over everything and presumably light the house on fire. This song is a brilliant example of non-traditional storytelling, and as such it is the perfect story to showcase interactive storytelling in Ink.","\n","^This game was created for Knight Hacks 2019, the 36-hour hackathon hosted by the University of Central Florida between March 1, 2019 and March 3, 2019.","\n","ev","str","^More about the song.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^More about the authors.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":4},"ev","str","^Start game.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-2","flg":4},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"song"},"\n",{"#f":7}],"c-1":["^ ",{"->":"authors"},"\n",{"#f":7}],"c-2":["^ ",{"#":"CLEAR"},"\n",{"->":"start"},{"#f":7}]}],{"#f":3}],"song":[["^The song name \"111 Winchester\" contains references to pop culture as well as references personal to the band and local folklore. In an interview, the singer claims the number (111) was chosen as a reference to a street near the recording studio where they recorded to the song, as well as because it contains the number eleven, a reference to Netflix horror series Stranger Things.  The street name \"Winchester\" is a reference to the Winchester Mystery House, which was once the home to Sarah Winchester, widow to the infamous firearm businessman William Wirt Winchester. The band chose this house as a reference – or possibly as a setting to their song – because of the stories of how Mrs. Winchester felt she was being haunted, so she was constantly trying to appease the ghosts by adding features to the mansion haphazardly, often creating confusing architecture such as doors leading to nothing, stairs leading into the ceiling, and other such oddities. The actual address to this residence is 525 S Winchester.","\n","^The full lyrics to the song can be read here: www.genius.com/I-the-mighty-111-winchester-lyrics.","\n","ev","str","^Go back.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},{"c-0":["^ ",{"#":"CLEAR"},"\n",{"->":"begin"},{"#f":7}]}],{"#f":3}],"authors":[["^Stephanie Pena and Leehe Mahalal are both students majoring in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida.
